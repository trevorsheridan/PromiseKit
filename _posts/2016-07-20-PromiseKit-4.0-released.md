title: PromiseKit 4.0 Released
---

# PromiseKit 4.0 is not yet released!

> PromiseKit 4 will be released once Xcode 8 is released. The current version is available, as the swift-3.0 branch.

Notable changes:

### Minimum Deployment Target

* PromiseKit now requires a deployment target >= macOS 10.10, the deployment targets for iOS, watchOS and tvOS are unchanged.

### `catch` Returns

* Swift 3 now allows keywords to be used as member functions, so thankfully we have restored `catch`.

### Initializer Changes

* We have moved all initializers except `Promise { fulfill, reject in }` to class methods to prevent ambiguity in usage and make the compiler happy for the 90% use case.

### `recover` Behavior Change
* `recover` now takes a `CatchPolicy` which means it **by default** no longer “catches” cancellation errors, you should vet any use of `recover`. Probably this is actually what you wanted all along.

### `@import PromiseKit;` works

* You can now `@import PromiseKit;`, before this wouldn’t import the whole library in an effort to prevent Swift and ObjC seeing the parts of PromiseKit designed for the other. We now properly use `NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT` et al. and thus the build-system manages symbol visibility for us.

### `Error.when` Removed

### `join()` Behavior Change

Your old joins won't compile, so you’ll notice this change for sure.

### Unused Return Value Warning

`then` will warn if you don't use the promise it returns. This is because it is typically a bug to not use the promise and indicates an unterminated promise chain.

> All chains should terminate at a `catch` handler or be returned from a function that will then terminate the chain at a `catch` handler.

However ocassionally it is legitimate to not terminate a chain, in such cases you can hide the warning by making it clear to the compiler that you are happy to ignore the result:

```swift
_ = foo.then{ /*…*/ }
```


### `AnyPromise -finally`

Renamed always so as to be consistent with `Promise<T>`, and because `finally` was not a good metaphor for promises relative to the `try`, `catch`, `finally` objc exception pattern we were originally partially emulating with PMK1.


### OMGHTTPURLRQ / Alamofire

OMGHTTPURLRQ is no longer a dependency of the `Foundation` extensions, instead it is now its own subspec: https://github.com/PromiseKit/OMGHTTPURLRQ

An Alamofire extension was added: https://github.com/PromiseKit/Alamofire

So from now on you should choose one of the two to handle the parts of HTTP networking that Apple left out:

```ruby
# CocoaPods
pod "PromiseKit/Alamofire", "~> 1.0"     # pick
pod "PromiseKit/OMGHTTPURLRQ", "~> 1.0"  # one

# Carthage
github "PromiseKit/Alamofire" ~> 1.0     # pick
github "PromiseKit/OMGHTTPURLRQ" ~> 1.0  # one
```

The default podspec *no longer* imports `OMGHTTPURLRQ`.
